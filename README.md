# Codeyoung Trial-Class Booking

Parents land on a scrolling home page (hero, courses, about, newsletter, parent reviews, doubt box) and book a free trial class **without creating an account**. The nav bar has Home, Courses, About, Contact, Help (Contact and Help are placeholders) and a **Book a Trial Class** button that opens the form at `/book`.

The booking journey:

1. **Details page** – name, email, phone (with country code) and time zone → **Book a Trial Class**.
2. **Date & time page** – pick a date on the calendar (left) and a time slot (right). If every mentor is full the right side shows **No Slots Available**; otherwise it shows how many time slots are free that day.
3. **Confirmation page** – the booked time, the mentor's name and the dummy class link.

The system then assigns a free mentor automatically and emails **both** people:
- the **parent**: the class time in *their* local time, the mentor's name and the join link;
- the **mentor**: the *same* class in *their own* local time (India), the parent's name and the join link.

Example: a UK parent booking 5:30–6:30 PM (BST) is shown to the mentor as 10:00–11:00 PM IST (UTC+05:30). In winter, when the UK is on GMT, the same wall-clock time is 11:00 PM–12:00 AM IST. Conversions use IANA time zones, so daylight saving is always correct.

Stack: React + Vite · Node.js + Express · PostgreSQL.

## Run it

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and PostgreSQL 14+.

```bash
# 1. Database
createdb codeyoung_booking
psql -d codeyoung_booking -f database/schema.sql -f database/seed.sql

# 2. API  (http://localhost:8090)
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # set DATABASE_URL (user/password) for your PostgreSQL
npm install
npm run dev

# 3. Web app  (http://localhost:5173), in a second terminal
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and book a class. Until SMTP is configured, both emails are printed in the **API terminal** (look for `SIMULATED EMAIL`).

> Upgrading from the earlier version that had parent accounts? Just run the `psql … -f database/schema.sql -f database/seed.sql` line again: it detects the old tables and rebuilds them (old test bookings are discarded). If the API says "Database is not ready", this is the fix.

### Mentors' names and emails
The 10 mentors live in the `mentors` table (`database/seed.sql`). Their emails are placeholders (`mentor01@codeyoung.example`). To send to real inboxes:

```sql
UPDATE mentors SET name = 'Asha Verma', email = 'asha@gmail.com' WHERE email = 'mentor01@codeyoung.example';
```

### Sending real emails (e.g. Gmail)
Set these in `backend/.env` and restart the API. For Gmail, create an *App password* (Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords):

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your.address@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=<16-character app password>
EMAIL_FROM=Codeyoung Trial Classes <your.address@gmail.com>
```

### Tests
```bash
cd backend  && npm test    # unit tests always run; API+database tests need TEST_DATABASE_URL
cd frontend && npm test    # full parent journey, calendar, validation, "No Slots Available"
```
For the database tests create an empty database (`createdb codeyoung_test`) and set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`. They rebuild the tables of that database, so never point it at real data.

## How the requirements are met

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| 10 mentors | Seeded in `database/seed.sql` with name and email. |
| 20 slots per day | 10 mentors × 2 classes = 20. After the 20th booking the day shows **No Slots Available: no slot is available today, try tomorrow**, with a *Try tomorrow* button. Tested for India, UK, Ireland and US time zones, in summer and winter. |
| Max 2 classes / mentor / day | A mentor never gets more than 2 classes on any calendar day as seen by the mentor (India), by the parent booking, or by any parent already booked with that mentor, so the limit holds whether you count by Indian date, UK date or US date. Inside a transaction with a Postgres advisory lock, so parallel bookings cannot oversubscribe a mentor (tested with 15 simultaneous requests). |
| Automatic mentor assignment | The free mentor with the fewest classes that day is chosen. |
| Local times everywhere | Times are stored in UTC. The parent sees their chosen zone; the mentor's email uses the mentor's zone. Every time carries the zone name and UTC offset. |
| Daylight saving | IANA zones via `date-fns-tz`. Times that do not exist (spring forward) or occur twice (fall back) are never offered and are rejected by the API. |
| Dummy links | A unique link per booking, shown on the confirmation page and in both emails. |
| No mentor available | The slot list shows **No Slots Available**; if someone takes a slot a moment earlier, the parent gets a clear message and the list refreshes. |

### Mentor shifts
All mentors are in India, so shifts are staggered (shifts may cross midnight) to give US/UK parents sensible hours. All times Asia/Kolkata:

| Mentors | Shift | Covers well |
|---|---|---|
| 01–03 | 09:00–21:00 | India, UK mornings |
| 04–06 | 17:00–03:00 | UK afternoon/evening, US mornings |
| 07–10 | 01:00–14:00 | UK midday, US afternoon/evening |

Parents can choose class start times between 07:00 and 21:00 their local time (`BOOKABLE_FROM_HOUR` / `BOOKABLE_TO_HOUR`).

### Behaviour worth knowing
- **One upcoming trial class per email address** (`MAX_ACTIVE_TRIALS_PER_PARENT`, `0` = unlimited), so one family cannot hold many of the 20 daily slots.
- **Cancelling** is possible from the confirmation page; the parent's email contains that link. Cancelling frees the mentor and emails both sides.
- Contact details (email/phone) are never returned by the API; booking ids are unguessable UUIDs.
- Booking requests are rate-limited per IP.

## Project layout

```
backend/src
  routes/booking.routes.js     validation (zod) + response shaping
  services/booking.service.js  transaction, limits, queries
  services/allocation.js       pure rules: working hours (incl. overnight), daily cap, mentor choice
  utils/time.js                time-zone / DST maths and formatting
  utils/email.js               SMTP, or console output when SMTP is not configured
database/schema.sql, seed.sql
frontend/src
  pages/DetailsPage, SchedulePage, ConfirmationPage
  components/Calendar.jsx
```

## API
| Method | Path | |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD&timezone=Europe/London` | free start times for that parent-local date |
| POST | `/api/bookings` | `{ name, email, phone: "+44 7700900123", startLocal: "2026-10-12T17:00", parentTimezone }` |
| GET | `/api/bookings/:id` | |
| POST | `/api/bookings/:id/cancel` | |
| GET | `/api/health` | |

Errors return `{ message, code }` (e.g. `NO_MENTOR_AVAILABLE`, `TRIAL_LIMIT_REACHED`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`).
